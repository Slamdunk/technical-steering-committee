## Items to discuss

### RFCs - discuss directly on GitHub?

As [noted by the user on the laminas slack](https://laminas.slack.com/archives/C4QBQUEG5/p1602604527127400), our current issue template suggests that
new features/RFCs should be posted to the forums for discussion.

That is quite inefficient, since:

 * the amount of users following the forum is a fraction of the users following our repositories
 * it is one more step for people to contribute

It could be a good idea to just endorse opening issues as "feature request" or "RFC" instead, since all the Laminas TSC members and community members
are quite familiar with PR/issue tooling of GitHub.
